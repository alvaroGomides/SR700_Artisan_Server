# SR700-Artisan-PDServer-Phidget

Extension of the SR700-Artisan-PDServer (https://github.com/infinigrove/SR700-Artisan-PDServer) to use with the Phidget and to simplify the setup and configuration with Artisan (https://artisan-scope.org/).

1. Phidget setup

Install the Phidget driver for your machine: https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Operating_System_Support

Download and install the Python module from here:https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Language_-_Python

2. Install this Server with: 

pip install SR700-Artisan-PDServer-Phidget

3. Start the server with:

Start_SR700_Artisan_Server.py 

(both the SR700 Roaster and the Phidget must be attached before starting this command )

If the server is running correctly you should see something like this:

[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0
[State:idle] Temp SR700:150 Temp Phidget 52 Target temp: 150 Fan Speed: 1 Time left: 0

4. In Artisan go under help and select Load Settingsâ€¦

Use this file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucapinello/SR700-Artisan-PDServer-Phidget/master/settings/artisan-settings.aset

The roasting profiles are created through alarms, a generic profile is already loaded.

Now you are ready to roast!

Hit Start, and keep in mind that the first 30sec are for preheating the machine. 

You can create custom profiles with this other tool I wrote: https://github.com/lucapinello/create_artisan_alarms_phidget
